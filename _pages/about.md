I am a researcher dedicated to engineering innovation, sustainability, and global impact. I am currently a member of Professor [David Clarke](https://clarke.seas.harvard.edu)'s lab at Harvard University, where I study high-temperature materials for more efficient engines. During my doctoral research at Northeastern University, I worked in Professor [Yi Zheng](https://nanoenergy.sites.northeastern.edu)'s lab working on materials and devices for sustainable water purification and cooling. I am also the CEO of Boston-based startup company [Planck Energies](https://www.planckenergies.com), where we are working to make cheaper, greener passive radiative cooling technologies more accessible across the globe.
